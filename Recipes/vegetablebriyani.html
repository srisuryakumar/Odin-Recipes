        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaf, and cumin seeds. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onion and cook until it turns golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the mixed vegetables and cook for a few minutes until they start to soften</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, mint leaves, coriander leaves, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the yogurt mixture to the pot and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring well to coat the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add the drained rice to the pot and gently stir to combine with the vegetables and spices.</li>
            <li>Pour enough water into the pot to cover the rice by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and fluffy.</li>
            <li>If using saffron, soak a few strands in warm milk and drizzle it over the cooked rice for added flavor and color.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice with a fork, remove the whole spices if desired, and serve the vegetable biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad.</li>
